This Git repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from the book "Core Java for the Impatient" by Cay S. Horstmann. 

The repository is organized by chapter, and each chapter directory contains the corresponding exercises in separate Java files. 

The code is well-documented and follows industry-standard coding practices. 

These solutions are intended to serve as a reference for anyone seeking to improve their proficiency in Java programming.
